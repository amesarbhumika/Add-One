I got inspired by the concept of the game and thought to extend it furthur by adding levels to Add One! :) 


⬇️Objective⬇️⁣⁣
⁣⁣
🔅The goal of Add One is to add 1 to each of the numbers of a 4-digit sequence, as many times as you can in limited seconds.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
🔅Let me make you understand this with an example, assume, question is 2753, so the right answer to this question should be:⁣⁣ ⁣ 
2 + 1 = 3⁣ 
7 + 1 = 8⁣ 
5 + 1 = 6⁣⁣
3 + 1 = 4⁣⁣
⁣
That is, 3864⁣⁣
